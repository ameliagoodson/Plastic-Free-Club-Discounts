# Plastic Free Club Discounts App

## Quick Commands
- **Deploy functions**: `shopify app deploy --force`
- **Start dev**: `npm run dev` 
- **Run tests**: `npm run test:watch`

## Testing Setup ‚úÖ
- Vitest configured with auto-watch mode
- Tests cover discount calculation logic and multi-product scenarios
- Run `npm run test:watch` during development for auto-testing

## Discount Logic
- Calculates from compare-at-price (not retail price)
- Implements "best price wins" automatically
- Expected discount for your 3-product test:
  - Moisturizer ($34): $3.40 discount
  - Lip balm ($8 vs $10): $0 discount (retail better)
  - Vitamin C ($39 vs $42): $1.20 discount
  - **TOTAL: $4.60** (but you're seeing $3.40 - need to investigate)
